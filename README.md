# Nonlinear Sheaf Diffusion 

This repository contains the code for the paper [Sheaf Diffusion Goes Nonlinear: Enhancing GNNs with Adaptive Sheaf Laplacians](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MGQtGV5gPO) (GRaM Workshop @ ICML 2024).

**In Progress: the code is not ready yet and will be available soon.**
